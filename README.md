# If you are not using Pipenv, follow these steps:

1. make sure you have python3 virtualenv installed; otherwise pip/apt-get install it.
2. create a virtual environment by running: "python3 -m venv env" outside the git repository. 
3. activate your virtual environment by doing: "source ~/path-to-venv/bin/activate"
4. go to the scitech website directory, and run "cat Pipfile" to see what packages you need to install.
5. go through each package and install it. 
6. run the server by going to the root folder of the repo and typing "python manage.py runserver"
7. deactivate your virtual env and make sure to reactivate it next time you are launching the server.
